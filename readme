Overview
Describe the purpose and goals of your project. Mention what the project does, what problem it solves, and any unique features or benefits.

Installation
Provide instructions on how to install your project. Include prerequisites and step-by-step instructions.

bash
Copy code
pip install sui_code_generator
If there are specific dependencies or considerations (e.g., Python version), mention them here.

Usage
Explain how to use your command-line tool to generate SUI blockchain smart contracts and modify existing files.

Generating Smart Contracts
To generate a new smart contract file:

bash
Copy code
generate_sui_contract generate <filename>
Replace <filename> with the desired name of the contract file.

Adding Functions, Conditionals, and Loops
To add a function to an existing contract file:

bash
Copy code
generate_sui_contract add_function <filename> <function_name>
To add a conditional statement to an existing contract file:

bash
Copy code
generate_sui_contract add_conditional <filename>
To add a loop to an existing contract file:

bash
Copy code
generate_sui_contract add_loop <filename>
Examples
Provide practical examples of how to use your project with different commands and options.

Example 1: Generating a Token Contract
bash
Copy code
generate_sui_contract generate_token my_token.move
Example 2: Adding a Function to a Contract
bash
Copy code
generate_sui_contract add_function my_contract.move transfer_ownership
Example 3: Adding a Conditional Statement to a Contract
bash
Copy code
generate_sui_contract add_conditional my_contract.move
Example 4: Adding a Loop to a Contract
bash
Copy code
generate_sui_contract add_loop my_contract.move
